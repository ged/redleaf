Redleaf is an RDF library for Ruby. It's composed of a hand-written C binding to the Redland RDF
Libraries, and a high-level, more idiomatic layer written in Ruby that wraps the low-level Redland
API functions.

It's still incomplete, but we'll publish more details when it's ready for people to use.

In the meantime, you can check out the current development source with Subversion from the 
following URL:

    svn://deveiate.org/Redleaf/trunk

The project page is also likely to have more details:
