= Redleaf

Redleaf is an RDF library for Ruby. It's composed of a hand-written binding for the Redland RDF
Library, and a high-level layer that adds some idioms that Rubyists might find familiar.

It's currently not quite feature-complete, but the extension already binds a good slice of the
functionality that is offered by Redland. It should be considered to be of alpha quality: while
we've already started building projects using it, we expect that the API may have to change
somewhat as we learn more, and it has not yet been throughly tested in a production setting.

In the meantime, you can help out by checking out the current development source with Subversion
from the following URL:
