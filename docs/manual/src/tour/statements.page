h3. What's In A Statement?

Statements are the basic building-block of RDF, and are also known as _triples_, as they have three parts: a _subject_, a _predicate_, and an _object_. Each statement is a way of asserting some fact about the statement's _subject_, namely that the _object_ of the statement is related to the _subject_ via the relationship described by the _predicate_.

You can construct a Statement via the usual means:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Create a new, empty statement" } ?>
st = Redleaf::Statement.new
<?end?>

This statement has @nil@ as its subject, predicate, and object, so it's not _complete_. A complete statement is one which has a valid value for all three. You can ask a statement if it's complete in the usual Ruby way:

<?example { language: ruby, caption: "Is this statement complete?" } ?>
st = Redleaf::Statement.new
st.complete?
# => false
<?end?>
