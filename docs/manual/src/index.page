Redleaf is an RDF library for Ruby. It's intended as a high-level, approachable, idiomatic binding to the "Redland library":http://librdf.org/ by Dave Beckett. If you're interested in the who and why of the project, you can read more in the <?link Project Information ?> page.

If you just want to get started, it's easy (assuming you "know a little about RDF":http://www.w3.org/2007/02/turtle/primer/ already):

<?example { } ?>
require 'redleaf'

graph = Redleaf::Graph.new
graph.load( 'http://www.w3.org/2000/04/mem-news/public-groups.rdf' )

graph[ URI('mailto:semantic-web@w3.org'), nil, nil ].each do |stmt|
	puts "%s -> %s" % [ stmt.predicate, stmt.object ]
end
<?end?>
