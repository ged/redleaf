h2. <%= page.config['title'] %>

Redleaf is an RDF library for Ruby. It's intended as a high-level, approachable, Ruby-idiomatic binding to the "Redland library":http://librdf.org/ by Dave Beckett. If you're interested in the who and why of the project, that's covered in <?link Project Information ?>.

h3. Getting Started

If you don't already know a little about RDF, I'd highly recommend at least skimming one of the RDF Primers; I prefer "the one that uses Turtle examples":http://www.w3.org/2007/02/turtle/primer/, as I find the XML syntax to be cluttered and unnecessarily awkward, but you may prefer "the regular XML one":http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-primer/.

The <?link Design Overview ?> is a high-level introduction to the basic design philosophy behind Redleaf, how it relates to Redland and RDF, with links into the <?link Guided Tour ?> for the classes it mentions in case you want more detail about a particular part.

If you'd rather just start with a roadmap of classes, you should review the <?link Guided Tour ?>, which is an examples-based look at each class in a cookbook-style format. 

Finally, there's the <?api "API documentation":README ?> generated from the source code itself.
