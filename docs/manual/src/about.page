Redleaf is an alternative Ruby interface to the "Redland RDF library":http://librdf.org/ by Dave Beckett. It was written to serve as the backend for an RDF-based metadata component for the ThingFish digital asset management server. I explored several other existing RDF libraries and found nothing that was both complete *and* followed familiar Ruby idioms.

h3. Other RDF Libraries

Some other libraries I tried:

<dl class="link-catalog">
	<dt>Redland – "http://librdf.org/":http://librdf.org/</dt>
	<dd>The Ruby binding for the excellent collection of RDF libraries grouped under
		the name 'Redland' came the closest to what I wanted. The SWIG-based interface
		ultimately still showed through, and my initial trials exposed some design decisions
		that I didn't feel like I could work around. I'm of course still using the same
		excellent C backend, but I'm custom-fitting it to Ruby in a more intimate way, and 
		adding what I think is a more-natural way of using RDF from Ruby for practical 
		tasks.</dd>
	<dt>Semitar – "http://semitar.projects.semwebcentral.org/":http://semitar.projects.semwebcentral.org/</dt>
	<dd>This was a project that Rich Kilmer described to me in great detail at the 2003 RubyConf, 
		but it has languished since then due to Rich being perpetually swamped with some other
		exciting new project or other. While it doesn't appear to be useable in its current state, 
		large parts of the high-level interface are heavily influenced by the ideas expressed in 
		it..</dd>
	<dt>Rena — "http://www.tom.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~sakai/hiki/?Rena":http://www.tom.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~sakai/hiki/?Rena</dt>
	<dd>A pure-Ruby RDF library, originally written by Masahiro Sakai, Rena provides some of
		the same low-level functionality that is (more completely) addressed by Redland, but
		it hasn't been maintained since 2004 and is a bit sparse and depends on a @hyperset@ 
		library which seems to have disappeared. 
	<dt>Reddy – "http://github.com/tommorris/reddy/tree":http://github.com/tommorris/reddy/tree
	<dd>A newish libxml-based library that seems to have started out as a fork of Rena. I didn't
		find it complete enough to use for what I need it to do.
	</dd>
	<dt>Others</dt>
	<dd>There are a few other libraries for doing RDF stuff on Rubyforge and Github, but nothing 
		that is as feature-complete or flexible as Redland, and nothing that presents a 
		more-Rubyish interface. That's not to say that they're bad, of course, they just didn't
		scratch my itch.</dd>
