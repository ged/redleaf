Redleaf is composed of a hand-written C binding to the "Redland RDF Libraries":http://librdf.org/,
and a high-level, more idiomatic layer written in Ruby that wraps the low-level Redland API
functions. The high-level layer is intended to make Redland mesh more naturally with the way Ruby
works, so the objects for working with RDF behave the same as any other Ruby object. The intent is
to make adding RDF to a Ruby application as simple as possible.

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_Description_Framework">Wikipedia</a> describes RDF as:

<blockquote>
[A] family of World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) specifications, originally designed as a metadata data model, which has come to be used as a general method of modeling information through a variety of syntax formats.
</blockquote>

h2. Other RDF Libraries

I tried out a few other RDF libraries for Ruby, and while each of them is full of great ideas, I ultimately wanted something a little different than what any of them offered.

<dl class="link-catalog">
	<dt>Redland – "http://librdf.org/":http://librdf.org/</dt>
	<dd>The Ruby binding for the excellent collection of RDF libraries grouped under
		the name 'Redland' came the closest to what I wanted. The SWIG-based interface
		ultimately still showed through, and my initial trials exposed some design decisions
		that I didn't feel like I could work around. I'm of course still using the same
		excellent C backend, but I'm custom-fitting it to Ruby in a more intimate way, and 
		adding what I think is a more-natural way of using RDF from Ruby for practical 
		tasks.</dd>
	<dt>Semitar – "http://semitar.projects.semwebcentral.org/":http://semitar.projects.semwebcentral.org/</dt>
	<dd>This was a project that Rich Kilmer described to be in great detail at the 2003
		RubyConf, but it has languished since then due to Rich being perpetually swamped
		with some other exciting new project or other. Large parts of the high-level interface
		are heavily influenced by his ideas.</dd>
	<dt>Rena — "http://www.tom.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~sakai/hiki/?Rena":http://www.tom.sfc.keio.ac.jp/~sakai/hiki/?Rena</dt>
	<dd>A pure-Ruby RDF library, originally written by Masahiro Sakai, Rena provides some of
		the same low-level functionality that is (more completely) addressed by Redland, but
		it hasn't been maintained since 2004 and is a bit sparse and depends on a @hyperset@ 
		library which seems to have disappeared. There's also another more-recent project 
		called "Rena" by Tim Morris (http://github.com/tommorris/rena/new) that claims
		some ancestry with Sakai's code, but seems in reality to share only the name[1].
	</dd>
	<dt>Others</dt>
	<dd>There are a few other libraries for doing RDF stuff on Rubyforge, but nothing that
		is as feature-complete or flexible as Redland, and nothing that presents a 
		more-Rubyish interface. That's not to say that they're bad, of course, just not
		my cup of tea.</dd>

fn1. I base this assertion on the fact that the two projects share only two like-named files in
common, each of which share only blank lines and <code>end</code>s. Tom's version is under a
different copyright which makes no mention of the "original" code, is under a different license, and
behaves very differently than the original Rena. That said, what code there is is well-tested, seems
pretty clean, and seems to be actively worked on. -MG
