    * Fixed require order between the extension and the libraries to avoid things not being 
    defined in the right order for requires other than 'redleaf'
    * Added valid backend detection to Redleaf::Store -- now installations that don't have one of
    Redland's backends will generate sensible errors if that backend is used.
    * Updated the build system
    * Added an exceptions.rb file to contain Redleaf-specific exception classes.
    * A little more work on the diagrams and manual
    * Added a 'pending' to the sqlite spec for installations whose Redland doesn't support it
    (like the CruiseControl box)

   A bit more work on Redleaf::Statement: #subject and #subject= now working for the most part. Still have some restrictions left to implement, and the literal conversion code is not yet well-tested.

    Redleaf's Logger object had already been garbage-collected during Ruby's
    exit sequence.
    * Turned on gdb debugging flag for the build.
    * Added the manual-generation framework, and an initial page.
