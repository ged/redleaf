            spec/redleaf/graph_spec.rb
            lib/redleaf/graph.rb

    * Redleaf::Graph
    - #dup now copies statements, too. This diverges from Redland, but I keep expecting it
    in Ruby-land, and I expect others will, too.
    - Fixed node-equivalency specs, and then fixed node-equivalency implementation, which
    always thought graphs with the same number of statements were equivalent.

    * Redleaf::Graph
    - A bunch of work on graph-equivalency
    - Added a comment block for planned functionality and how it maps onto Redland
    - Commented out some of the memory-check debugging to reduce the logging spam
    - Fixed #inspect output
    - Added #supports_contexts?, #contexts, and #dup
    * Renamed Redleaf::NodeConversion to Redleaf::NodeUtils to better convey
    what its purpose is
    * Fixed a bug in Redleaf::HashesStore's constructor -- it now handles an optionhash-only
    call properly.
    * Added a 'rebuild' task to the local Rakefile to facilitate easy clobber + build
    * Added some progress message to the monkeypatched Mkrf-generated Rakefile

    * Updated build system.
    * Factored out a bunch of the common tasks into global node functions into a
    node utility function collection.
    * Redleaf::Graph:
    - Added #search and #each_statement (with #[] and #each aliases,
    respectively), and added a #delete alias for #remove.
    - Mixes in Enumerable
    * Factored node-conversion functions out into the Redleaf::NodeConversions

    * Fixed require order between the extension and the libraries to avoid things not being 
    defined in the right order for requires other than 'redleaf'
    * Added valid backend detection to Redleaf::Store -- now installations that don't have one of
    Redland's backends will generate sensible errors if that backend is used.
    * Updated the build system
    * Added an exceptions.rb file to contain Redleaf-specific exception classes.
    * A little more work on the diagrams and manual
    * Added a 'pending' to the sqlite spec for installations whose Redland doesn't support it

    * Fixed extension initializer
    * Started fleshing out the Ruby side of the library with some basic utilities, mixins, etc.
    * Updated the template for the W3C parser spec to reflect currently thinking about the
    API.
    * Removed the old w3c_parser_spec.rb file, as it will be autogenerated when the library
    gets that far.
