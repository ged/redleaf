   A bit more work on Redleaf::Statement: #subject and #subject= now working for the most part. Still have some restrictions left to implement, and the literal conversion code is not yet well-tested.

    * Fixed the bug that caused a segfault if the world finalizer was run after
    Redleaf's Logger object had already been garbage-collected during Ruby's
    exit sequence.
    * Turned on gdb debugging flag for the build.
    * Added the manual-generation framework, and an initial page.
