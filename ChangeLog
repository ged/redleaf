            Rakefile.local
            lib/redleaf/graph.rb

    * Added initial connection of Redland's logging callback to Redleaf's logger. This is as-yet
    untested.
    * Added initial minimal implementation of Redleaf::Graph and Redleaf::Statement classes.
    * Made :build a dependency of the :spec task so the C sources will (re)build if necessary before
    the specs run.
