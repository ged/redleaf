= W3C and RDFa Auto-Generated Specs

As mentioned in the top-level README, there are rake task libraries contained in this directory that fetch manifests and test data for two standard test suites. 

== The W3C RDF Tests

See: http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-testcases/

Files:

spec/data/latest_All.zip::
  The W3C test suite archive, fetched by a Rake task.
spec/data/w3ctests::
  The directory that contains the unpacked W3C test manifest and test
  data. Unpacked by a Rake task.
spec/spec_generator.rb::
  Code for a class that reads the W3C test manifest and generates
  three spec files from the test descriptions therein. This is loaded by
  `w3ctest-tasks.rb`.
spec/templates/w3c_{entailment,miscellaneous,parser}_spec.template::
  ERB templates for the three spec files.
spec/w3c_{entailment,miscellaneous,parser}_spec.rb::
  The specs generated by the `w3ctests:generate` task, one for each type
  of test in the test suite.
spec/w3cissues.yml::
  A YAML file which contains a list of specs which fail, along with 
  a hypothesis as to the reason it fails. This will eventually be read
  by the spec_generator, and will cause it to generate a 'pending' spec
  instead of a normal one. I intend to eventually either make all the 
  tests pass, or list ones that I don't intend to try to fix in this 
  file. 
spec/w3ctest-tasks.rb::
  The Rake tasks that generate the specs, declared in the 'w3ctests' 
  namespace.


== The RDFa Tests

See: http://www.w3.org/2006/07/SWD/RDFa/testsuite/

Files:

spec/data/rdfatests::
  The directory that contains the RDFa test suite data files. Fetched 
  by a Rake task.
spec/rdfatest-tasks.rb::
  The Rake tasks that generate the specs, declared in the 'rdfatests' 
  namespace.
spec/templates/w3c_rdfa_spec.template::
  The ERB template for the RDFa spec file.
spec/w3c_rdfa_spec.rb::
  The spec file generated by the 'rdfatests:generate' task.
