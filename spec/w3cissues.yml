  description: test depends on malformed URI
  details: |-
    The RDFCore Working Group decided to allow unescaped UTF-8 characters in URI 
    references (http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/w3c-rdfcore-wg/2002Apr/0474.html), but the
    URI RFC doesn't appear to allow them. The Ruby URI library, accordingly, raises an 
    exception when it encounters a malformed URI, so this test case fails with:
    
        bad URI(is not URI?): http://example.org/#Andr√©
    
    Need to figure out how to handle this situation; perhaps ask Dan Brickley since he was
    on that working group.
